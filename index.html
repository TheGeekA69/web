<h1>A beginner's guide to macOS Terminal</h1>

<h2>1: Making the Terminal yours</h2>

<div class="box">
<p>The terminal provides access to your Mac’s most advanced functions. In theory, everything you can do with a mouse, you can do in the Terminal. Should you then discard your trusty clicker and use Terminal to watch cat videos? Of course not.</p>

<p>If you want to make the most out of macOS, and take a dip at how Linux (and more generally UNIX) works, then you’re in the right place. The place where you finally become a “power-user” (wherever the boundary lies, but oh well).</p>

<p>The Terminal may seem scary at first with its bland and opaque background. The font may seem too small for you, too. And the first two lines may not even make sense. What about those ‘aliases’ you’ve seen, but don’t work in your .bashrc?</p>

<p>Don’t worry, we’ll address all of that in the present guide. The very least you need to make the Terminal your own and start scripting, developping or even learning. So, without further ado, let’s get started with customization!</p>

<div class="spacer"></div>
<h3>Customizing visuals</h3>
<div class="box">
<p>It means changing the background and text color, the size, the opacity, etc. Sure. But it also means changing the default shell (more on that later). So here’s how to tune the look-and-feel.</p>

<p>Open the Terminal: either by double-clicking the icon in Applications/Utilities or by toggling Spotlight (Command+Space) and looking up Terminal. Once opened, it should look like this:</p>

<p>Now go to Terminal > Preferences in your menu bar, or hit Command+, Go straight to the “Profiles” tab. You can use one of the presets here (I was using ‘Pro’ until recently) or make your own by clicking on the + button in the bottom left corner. Give your new profile a name and start customizing away!</p>

<p>In this article, we will create a highly transparent (but still legible) profile. We will also use a third-party font from JetBrains that you can download here. Most of the tweaking happens on this tab of the settings. First, click the rectangle next to “color and effect” and set the opacity to 30% and blur to 50%. You can optionally choose a different style for when the window is inactive (meaning not in focus). When done, close the small window. Remember to select your profile on the left to see the changes happen in real time. If they don’t, close the terminal window (not the settings!) and reopen one.</p>

<p>As for the font, go to your download folders and extract the zip. Go the ttf subfolder and select all the fonts then double-click. Alternatively, you can open the app Font Book, click the + button at the top of the window and select the ttf folder. When done, go back to your Terminal settings and click the Change button. Select JetBrains Mono in the Fixed Width collection. Set the size slider on the right to 13px, then character spacing to 1 and line spacing to 1.2. Close the window.</p>
